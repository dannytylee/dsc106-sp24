Bruce is a 2.5 year old (in human years) pug. He was rescued from The San Diego Pug Rescue when he was just a few months old. At work, he loves being pet and laying down. Outside of work, he loves eating food, cuddling with his mom, sleeping, and running around non-stop. He is extremely friendly and loving.
